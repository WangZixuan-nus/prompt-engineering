# 🧠 Prompt Engineering & API Integration with Python

This repository is a comprehensive guide and codebase for understanding and applying **prompt engineering** techniques along with **Python-based API integration**, particularly for working with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT series.

## 📌 Objectives

- Develop effective prompts for various NLP tasks
- Explore prompt evaluation and refinement strategies
- Automate prompt usage via Python scripts
- Document the full process from idea to implementation
