## Prompt Writing Tips
Summarize and Transfer Between Dialogues
After completing a stage of work in one conversation, start a new chat for the next stage. You can use a prompt like:

"Summarize what we've discussed so far."
Then copy and paste that summary into the new conversation to provide quick context.

Start Fresh When Context Is Unnecessary
If previous context is no longer important, it’s better to start a new conversation. Begin with a clear, standalone prompt like:

"Let's rework this from scratch."

One Task at a Time
Always focus on one task per prompt. Avoid combining multiple unrelated instructions. This improves clarity, reduces confusion, and leads to better results.
